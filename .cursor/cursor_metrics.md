# Cursor Metrics for Selin Project

## Development Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
- [x] Project directory structure created
- [x] Go 1.24.6 verified (ARM64)
- [x] Cursor project configuration initialized
- [x] User configuration directories created (config/, credentials/, templates/, user/)
- [x] Installation scripts created (install-tools.sh, verify-setup.sh)
- [x] External tools installation automated (kubectl, Helm, ArgoCD CLI)

### Phase 2: API/Interface Implementation
- [x] API Gateway scaffold with Go modules
- [x] Health/readiness/metrics endpoints implemented
- [x] Redis rate limiter integration (60 requests/minute)
- [x] WebSocket service scaffold with real-time streaming
- [x] Prometheus metrics integration
- [x] Unit tests for both services (passing)

### Phase 3: Backend Services & Infrastructure
- [x] Infrastructure services deployment manifests
  - [x] Weaviate vector database deployment
  - [x] PostgreSQL database deployment
  - [x] Redis cache deployment
  - [x] NFS storage configuration
- [x] Data collection services templates
  - [x] Reddit collector deployment template
- [x] Processing services structure
- [x] Batch jobs configuration (CronJobs)
  - [x] Daily processor
  - [x] Weekly analyzer
  - [x] Backup service
- [x] Monitoring setup (Prometheus configuration)
- [x] Secrets and ConfigMap templates
- [x] Kubernetes manifest validation (dry-run successful)

### Phase 4: Configuration & Documentation
- [x] User configuration templates created
  - [x] sources.yaml (data source configuration)
  - [x] preferences.yaml (learning preferences)
  - [x] schedules.yaml (collection schedules)
- [x] Service deployment template
- [x] Comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- [x] Project documentation organized

### Development Notes
- Project follows implementation_plan.mdc for structured development
- All configuration managed via user/ directory
- ARM64 optimization for Raspberry Pi deployment
- Kubernetes manifests validated with dry-run
- Unit tests implemented and passing for core services

### Next Steps (Pending Implementation)
- [ ] Individual data collector service implementations
